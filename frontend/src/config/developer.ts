const description = `
  The main goal of this project is to create a simple web application that allows the user to view uploaded images.
  
  The backend API was developed using .NET Core 6.0 and the frontend was developed using ReactJS.

  Some of the technologies used in this project are:
  - .NET Core 6.0 (C#)
  - ReactJS (TypeScript)
  - MongoDB (NoSQL Database)

  The frontend was made based on the pdf file provided by SSE.

  The backend was made based on my knowledge of .NET Core and the requirements of the frontend.

  I have also added some things to code like:
  - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
  - Dependency Injection
  - Unit Tests
  - Error Handling
